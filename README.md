# rltools

This is the real linux tools project, which is intended to be a mono repository containing all of the tools found to be useful while developing a complete Linux distribution.

these tools are intended to be useful to other projects as well, so feel free to make use of them if you find a use for them.

the repository is intended to be developed using trunk based development, as this is the only system properly compatible with continuous integration. It is a deliberate design goal to not recreate existing tools which are good enough, and already provided by someone else, but that does not mean that helper tools to make better use of them will not be developed.

The entire code base is intended to be developed under a gpl v2 only license.
